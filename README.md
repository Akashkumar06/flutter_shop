## Getting Started

this sample will consist a few branch.  Planned branch:

1. Skeletons -- this would be the first commit the sample with only App navigation, this is to show the simplest code how to get started.
2. PageContent -- this would be the second commit, which would contain the detailed UI to be developed.
3. Data -- 3rd commit, would be using GraphQL for the catalog and cart data, Prisma Cloud.
4. Security -- 4th commit, plan to use Firebase Auth.
